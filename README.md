# Quiz Game

## Description
This Quiz Game is a simple yet engaging project where users can answer a series of true or false questions. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The questions are presented one at a time, and the user's score is calculated based on the correctness of their answers.

## Features
- Object-oriented design for better code organization and reusability.
- True or false questions with dynamic scoring.
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions.

## Object-Oriented Design
The project is organized into the following classes:
- `Question`: Represents a single true or false question, storing the question text and correct answer.
- `Quiz`: Manages the flow of the quiz, including presenting questions, collecting user answers, and calculating the score.

## How to Play
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. The game will present a series of true or false questions.
3. Enter your answer by typing 't' for true or 'f' for false.
4. The game will provide feedback on whether your answer is correct and update your score.
5. After all questions are answered, your final score will be displayed.
